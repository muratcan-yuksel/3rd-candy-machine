**Countdown Clock
Since time immemorial, bees and man have lived in harmony. As recently as 10,000 years ago they have lived and maintained a sort of reciprocal lifestyle with one helping the other…. Until recently. Man has since become greedy in their industrial exploits and in turn have threatened the foundation of bee life. In an attempt to save their species, the Hive has birthed four rebellious queens who have brought with them 2,000 of their most loyal companions to the solana blockchain in an effort to save not only themselves but the planet and the metaverse. Unfortunately, they can’t do it by themselves; they need YOU to help them on their journey because “The Planet and the Metaverse NEEDZ BEEZ”.
